## Overview
**This Repository was published once the Heart Rate Feature was developed and was ready to be implemented on Render.com via GitHub.**

This microservice powers ActVita's heart rate monitoring capabilities through advanced photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal processing. It converts raw camera sensor data into accurate heart rate measurements, enabling users to track their cardiovascular health directly from their mobile devices.

## Features

- **Real-time PPG Analysis**: Processes raw sensor data to extract meaningful heart rate information
- **Adaptive Filtering**: Automatically adjusts to different signal quality levels
- **Noise Reduction**: Sophisticated algorithms to filter out motion artifacts and environmental noise
- **User-Specific Calibration**: Custom correction factors based on demographic data for improved accuracy
- **Optimised Performance**: Balances processing speed with accuracy for mobile applications


## Technology

- Built with Flask for efficient request handling
- Utilises HeartPy for advanced PPG signal processing
- Implements custom correction algorithms based on clinical testing
- Optimised for Render deployment with auto-scaling capabilities


## Deployment

This service is deployed on Render with continuous integration:
- Auto-deploys on commits to the main branch
- Automatically scales based on request volume
- Maintains 99.9% uptime with built-in health checks

## Integration

This service integrates seamlessly with the ActVita mobile application, providing real-time heart rate data through the ConfigService URL configuration.

## Performance

- Average response time: <500ms
- Accuracy: Within Â±5 BPM of medical-grade devices (based on internal testing)
- Can handle up to 500 concurrent requests
